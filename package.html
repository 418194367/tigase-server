  <h2>About</h2>
  <p><strong>Tigase Jabber/XMPP Server</strong> is <strong>Open Source and Free
    (GPL2)</strong> <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> based server. The
   goals behind the design and implementation of the server are: </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Make the server robust and reliable.</li>
   <li>Make the server secure communication platform.</li>
   <li>Make flexible server which can be applied to different use cases.</li>
   <li>Make extensible server which takes full advantage of XMPP protocol
    extensibility.</li>
   <li>Make the server easy to setup and maintain.</li>
  </ol>
  <dl>
   <dt><strong>Robust and reliable.</strong></dt>
   <dd><p>By robust and reliable server I mean the server which can handle many
     concurrent requests/connections and can run for a log time. By many
     concurrent requests/connections I mean as many as it is needed. The server
     is designed and implemented to handle milions of simultanous
     connections.</p> <p>It is not enough however to design and implement high
     load server and hope it will run well. The main focus in the project is put
     in tests. Tests are taken so seriously that dedicated <a
      href="http://testsuite.tigase.org/">testing framework</a> has been
     implemented. All server functions are considered as implemented only when
     they pass testing cycle. The testing cycle consists of 3 fundamental
     tests:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Functional tests - </strong> checking whether the function
      works at all.</li>
     <li><strong>Performance tests - </strong> checking whether the function
      performs well enough.</li>
     <li><strong>Stability tests - </strong> checking whether the function
      behaves well in long term run. It must handle hundreds of requests a
      second in several hours server run.</li>
    </ol>
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>Secure</strong></dt>
   <dd><p>There are a few elements of the security related to Jabber/XMPP
     server: secure data transmissions which is met by the implementation of
     <strong>SSL</strong> or <strong>TLS</strong> protocol, secure user
     authorization which is met by the implementation of <strong>DIGEST</strong>
     or <strong>SASL</strong> user authorization and secure deplyoment which is
     met by component architecture.</p> <p><strong>Secure deployment</strong> is
     a software installation which doesn't impact network security. Companies
     usually have their networks divided into 2 parts: <strong>DMZ</strong>
     which is partially open to outside world and <strong>Private
      network</strong> which is closed to outside world.</p> <p>If the
     Jabber/XMPP server have to provide effective way of communication between
     company eployees regardles they are in company office or outside (perhaps
     at customer site) it needs to accept connections from outside world. So the
     natural place for server deployment is a <strong>DMZ</strong> part. There
     is an issue however with such installation. Each company has normally
     established network users base and integrated authorization mechanizms. So
     it would be very good if Jabber server could use this mechanizms for users
     authorizations as well. Usually, however, authorization information is not
     available in <strong>DMZ</strong> and it shouldn't be.</p>
    <p><strong>Tigase server</strong> offers solution for such case. With it's
     component structure it can be easily deployed on any number machines and
     from the user point of view it is seen as a one logical Jabber server. So
     in our case we can install <em>Session Manager</em> module in
     <strong>private</strong> network part and <em>Client Connection
      Manager</em> with <em>Server Connection Manager</em> in
     <strong>DMZ</strong>.<br/> <em>Session Manager</em> connects to
     <strong>DMZ</strong> and receives all packets from users. Thus is can
     sacurely realize users authorization based on company authorization
     mechanizms. </p></dd>
   <dt><strong>Flexibile</strong></dt>
   <dd>There are many different Jabber/XMPP server use cases. The most obvious
    are:
    <ul>
     <li>Used as bussiness communication platform in small and medium companies
      server is not under heavy load. Instead for such deployments security is a
      key feature.</li>
     <li>Fo huge community websites or internet portals server is on the other
      side usually under very heavy load and have to support tousands or
      millions of simultanous connections and for such deployment we talk about
      different kind of security as the service is open to public anyway.</li>
     <li>For very small community deployments or for small home networks the key
      factor is ease to deploy and maintain.</li>
    </ul> <p>Architecture based on components allows you to run selected modules
     on separate machines so the server can be easily applied to all
     scenarious.<br/> For simple installation server generates config file which
     can be used almost stright away with very few modifications or sometimes
     even no config editing is required. For complex deployments though you can
     tweak configuration to your needs and setup Jabber server on as many
     physical machines as you need.</p>
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>Extensibile</strong></dt>
   <dd><p>The world changes all the time so people needs change as well.
     Jabber/XMPP protocol has been designed to be extensible to make it easy
     adding new features and apply it to different needs. As a result Jabber is
     a very effective platform not only for sending messages to mates. It can
     also be extended for sending instant notifications about events, it can be
     useful platform for on-line customer service, voice communication and all
     other cases where sending information instantly to other people is
     needed.</p> <p><strong>Tigase server</strong> has been designed to be
     extensible as well. Of course modular architecture makes it extensible as
     you can easily replace component which doesn't fullfill your requirements
     with another one better fiiting your needs. But this is not all. Another
     factor of extensibility is how easy is to replace component or add new
     extensions. The great focus has been put in server design API to make it
     easy for other software developers to create extensions and implement new
     features.</p></dd>
   <dt><strong>Easy</strong></dt>
   <dd><p>Complex computer networks consisting of many servers with different
     services are hard to maintain. There is no other way than employing
     professional staff and looking after the network.</p> <p>Not all networks
     are so complex however. Most small companies have just a few servers for
     their needs with services like e-mail, <code>HTTP</code> server with
     company website and that's it. They might want to add Jabber server to the
     collection of their services and don't want to dedicate much resources on
     setting it up and later maintanance. For such users default configuration
     is pretty much what they need. If operating system on the server is well
     configured then Tigase should pickup correct hostname.</p> <p>Tigase server
     is designed and implemnted to allow dynamic reconfiguration at runtime so
     there is no need for restarting server each time you want to change a
     configuration settings.</p> <p>There are also interfaces and handlers
     available to make it easy to implement web user interface for server
     monitoring and configuring. Such user interface will included in one of
     future releases.</p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>How <strong>Tigase</strong> fits in above needs? Look at use cases
   scenarios.</p>
  <p>The server is divided into logic components and each component can be
   deployed separately.</p>

  <h2>Compilation</h2>

  <p>Although the server doesn't need any third-party libraies apart from
   <em>Java 6.0 (1.6beta2)</em> compliant JVM to run, <a
    href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> tool and <a
    href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/">Ant-Contrib</a> are used to build
   binaries of <strong>Tigase</strong> applications and libraries. Another tools
   which is needed is a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> which is
   required to download the most recent sources from <strong>Tigase</strong>
   repository. <br/>
   To make it a list, again:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><a
     href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/install/index.html">JDK-1.6</a>
    - Java SDK to compile and run <strong>Tigase</strong> applications.</li>
   <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> - the build tool.</li>
   <li><a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/">Ant-Contrib</a> -
    <strong>Apache Ant</strong> extensions used by build script.</li>
   <li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> - version
    control system used by <strong>Tigase</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Install all above in standard way, appropriate for your operating
   system. It is enough if they are available in system <code>PATH</code>
   variable so you can execute them from command line.</p>
  <p><strong>Tigase Server</strong> has been divided into a few smaller
   subprojects some time ago. In order to have it all working together we need
   to compile them one by one. Here is step by step instruction how to do
   it. Assuming you already run command line shell and changed to directory
   where you want to keep all <strong>Tigase</strong> files do as follows:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Get <strong>tigase-utils</strong> sources and compile them:
    <pre>svn co https://svn.tigase.org/reps/tigase-utils/trunk/ utils
cd utils
ant clean jar
cd ..</pre>
   </li>
   <li>Get <strong>tigase-xmltools</strong> sources and compile them:
    <pre>svn co https://svn.tigase.org/reps/tigase-xmltools/trunk/ xmltools
cd xmltools
ant clean jar
cd ..</pre>
   </li>
   <li>Get <strong>tigase-server</strong> sources and compile them:
    <pre>svn co https://svn.tigase.org/reps/tigase-server/trunk/ server
cp xmltools/jars/tigase-xmltools.jar server/libs/
cp utils/jars/tigase-utils.jar server/libs/
cd server
ant clean jar</pre>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now you have <strong>Tigase Server</strong> compiled and ready to run. To
  check and make sure it is indeed compiled and can be executed you can try to
  start the server. Assuming you are in the directory where you executed the
  last compilation command for server sources run following command:</p>
  <p>On Linux system:</p>
  <pre>java -cp "libs/tigase-utils.jar:libs/tigase-xmltools.jar:jars/tigase-server.jar" tigase.server.XMPPServer</pre>
  <p>On MS Windows system:</p>
  <pre>java -cp "libs/tigase-utils.jar;libs/tigase-xmltools.jar;jars/tigase-server.jar" tigase.server.XMPPServer</pre>
  <p>If it all worked correctly you should see output similar to presented below:</p>
<pre>2006-10-04 17:00:38  ConfigRepository.init()             WARNING:  Can not open existing configuration file, creating new one
2006-10-04 17:00:38  XMLDB.setupNewDB()                  INFO:     Create empty DB.
2006-10-04 17:00:38  MessageRouter.addRegistrator()      INFO:     Adding registrator: Configurator
2006-10-04 17:00:38  MessageRouter.addComponent()        INFO:     Adding component: Configurator
2006-10-04 17:00:38  Configurator.setupLogManager()      WARNING:  DONE
2006-10-04 17:00:38  Configurator.setupLogManager()      WARNING:  DONE
2006-10-04 17:00:39  XMLRepository.<init>()              WARNING:  Can not open existing user repository file, creating new one</pre>
  <p>Now you can proceed to configuration document to learn how to tweak server
  settings or you can just start hacking server code and do experiments.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>To get server up and running you have to download from our site the most
   recent version of the binary package. Unpack it with the following
   command:</p>
  <p>On Unix like system:</p>
  <pre>tar -xzvf tigase-server-x.x.x-bx.tar.gz</pre>
  <p>On MS Windows system use any application which can handle either
   <code>zip</code> files or <code>tar.gz</code> files and unpack server package
   to selected directory.</p>
  <p>Sometimes after unpacking package on unix system startup script doesn't
   have execution permissions. To fix the problem you have to run following
   command:</p>
  <pre>chmod u+x ./bin/run-server.sh</pre>
  <p>Now all you need is <em>Java 6 (1.6 beta at the moment)</em> compilant
   virtual machine. You can run server from command line with simple
   command:</p>
  <pre>./bin/run-server.sh</pre>
  <p>You can see now a few messages with warning about missing configuration
   file and missin user repository file. These 2 files will be automaticaly
   created. Config file will be created just during first execution of the
   server and user repository file will be created when the first user is added
   to the system.</p>
  <p>You should be able now to connect to the server with Jabber/XMPP client of
   your choice.</p>
  <p>All possible command line parameters are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><code>-h</code> - prints help message about starting server.</li>
   <li><code>-v</code> - prints information about server version.</li>
   <li><code>-c file.xml</code> - defines location and name of <em>XML</em>
    configuration file. Default is <code>xmpp_server.xml</code> file in current
    directory. If you don't have config file it will be automaticaly created
    during first run with all default settings. It is very easy then to
    customize server to your own needs.</li>
   <li><code>-d [true|yes|false|no]</code> - turn on/off debug mode. Putting
    just '<code>-d</code>' without extra parameter is equal to "<code>-d
     true</code>".</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can now proceed to configuration section. Although in simple case
   installation most if default options should be correct sometimes you need to
   change server domain name if automatic detection didn't work.</p>

  <h2>Configuration</h2>
  <h3>Basic configuation.</h3>
  <p>Configuration settings are kept in <em>XML</em> file very similar in it's
   structure to <em>Java 5.0</em> <code>preferences</code> file. The most
   significant difference is possibility to assign multiple values to one key
   (entry). Another difference is that in configuration file all values are
   uuencoded so it is possible to keep different data in configuration even if
   they could cause xml parsing errors.</p>
  <p>If you need sample configuration file containing all used defaults
   just run server in usual way. If configuration file can not be found it is
   created with default settings. And even if there is an old configuration
   file with some settings missing server automaticly adds missing entries
   at startup time.</p>
  <p>Configuration file was not designed for manual editing so it
   is not recommended to do so. Unfortunately there are no user friendly
   interfaces available at the moment so here is a description how to edit the
   file and what to change.</p>

  <h4>Short configuration guide.</h4>

  <p>Options you most likely have to change at deployment time are:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Admin accounts - </strong> account names where all admin messages
   are sent.</li>
   <li><strong>Hostnames - </strong> real and virtual hostnames your server has
   to serve for.</li>
   <li><strong>Logs - </strong> setting related to log file location
    and how much information should be logged there.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Please let me know if you think more options should be described here.</p>

  <p>At the moment the only way to change configuration is to manually edit xml
   config file. So be prepared for tough times. The good news it that more user
   friendly interfaces are scheduled for next release. And it will be also
   reconfigure server at runtime without need to restart service.</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><strong>Admin accounts</strong></dt>
   <dd><p>This is the most likely thing to change after you install server and
     generate default configuration. Actually it is also the easiest option to
     customize.</p>
    <p>Open <code>tigase-config.xml</code> in you favourite text editor and search
     for string: <strong>"admins"</strong>. You should find section looking like
     this:</p>
    <pre>   &#60;entry type="String[]" key="admins">
    &#60;item value="admin%40your.hostname.com"/>
    &#60;item value="admin%40localhost"/>
   &#60;/entry></pre>
    <p>Characters "%40" stand for '@'. So assuming you have just 1 admin account
     on your installation which is: "frank@jabber.example.com" you need to
     replace above code with:</p>
    <pre>   &#60;entry type="String[]" key="admins">
    &#60;item value="frank%40jabber.example.com"/>
   &#60;/entry></pre>
    <p>And yes, you can just remove second entry with admin account:
     "admin@localhost" unless you really want to keep it. Be aware though all
     system messages will be sent to <strong>ALL</strong> admin accounts.<br/>
     Well, if the account does not exists the message is discarded and a
     warning is be printed in log file. Again, read it again, the previous
     sentence...<br/>
     It means that the admin account has to be also created in normal way on the
     Jabber server. Just register it using your Jabber client. The admin
     accounts setting works just as a forward instruction. So as a result all
     system and admin messages are forwarded to all admin accounts if they
     exist.<br/>
     Obviously you can have admin accounts as many as you like:</p>
    <pre>   &#60;entry type="String[]" key="admins">
    &#60;item value="frank%40jabber.example.com"/>
    &#60;item value="lucy%40jabber.example.com"/>
    &#60;item value="mark%40jabber.example.com"/>
    &#60;item value="brenda%40jabber.example.com"/>
    &#60;item value="luck%40jabber.example.com"/>
   &#60;/entry></pre>
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>Hostnames</strong></dt>
   <dd><p>This one might be a little bit more tricky than previous
    as <strong>hostnames</strong> setting has to be changed in a few
    places. Don't ask why now as this is <em>"Short configuration guide"</em>,
    you remember. Here we focus on <strong>how</strong> not
    on <strong>why</strong>.</p>
    <p>You have to search configuration file for
     string <strong>"hostnames"</strong>. There are more than one such sections
     and you have to find <strong>ALL</strong> sections looking like:</p>
    <pre>   &#60;entry type="String[]" key="hostnames">
    &#60;item value="your.hostname.com"/>
    &#60;item value="localhost"/>
   &#60;/entry></pre>
    <p>It may also look like:</p>
    <pre>   &#60;entry type="String[]" key="hostnames">
    &#60;item value="localhost"/>
   &#60;/entry></pre>
    <p>Depending how successful was mechanism for automatic hostname
     detection. It of course does not depends on your luck. It depends on network
     configuration on your server.</p>
    <p>The first form is more useful as it includes also hostname recognized in
     network environment. If it is correct then you can just leave it as it
     is. If it is incorrect you have to change it. Please remember, if you want
     your server to be able to communicate with other <em>Jabber/XMPP</em>
     servers the hostname you put there must resolve in DNS to your Jabber
     server machine IP address. In other words. If you try to connect from the
     Internet to machine with this hostname the connection should reach your
     Jabber server.</p>
    <p>And remember your Jabber server users' <em>JIDs (Jabber IDs)</em> can
     include only those hostnames which are included in the configuration. So
     for our case you can use only <em>JIDs</em>:
     <em>"user2@your.hostname.com"</em>, <em>"user1@your.hostname.com"</em> and
     so on.</p>
    <p>If you server have more Internet addresses (virtual domains) assigned to
     it your Jabber server can use them all. So your configuration may look like:</p>
    <pre>   &#60;entry type="String[]" key="hostnames">
    &#60;item value="your.hostname.com"/>
    &#60;item value="clien1.hostname.com"/>
    &#60;item value="another.hostname.com"/>
    &#60;item value="jabber.sample-domain.com"/>
    &#60;item value="jabber.some-project.org"/>
    &#60;item value="localhost"/>
   &#60;/entry></pre>
    <p>In such case users' <em>JIDs</em> on your Jabber server may include any
     of defined above domains like: <em>"user1@your.hostname.com"</em>,
     <em>"user1@clien1.hostname.com"</em>,
     <em>"user1@jabber.sample-domain.com"</em>. Each of these 3
     sample <em>JIDs</em> refer to different user account.</p>
    <p>Your server will accept connections only for domains defined in
     configuration file.</p>
    <p>In majority cases it does not matter whether you
     leave <strong>"localhost"</strong> or remove it. It is sometimes better to
     leave it though. So if you are not sure if you can remove it in your
     environment just leave it as is.</p>
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>Logs</strong></dt>
   <dd><p>Logging mechanism is very flexible in Tigase server. You can adjust
     separate logging level for each single component. You can also direct
     loggin to many different destinations like console, file, network socket
     and so on. Unfortunately it also mean it is a bit complex. The general
     idea however is quite simple so once you understand it it shouldn'd be
     difficult for you anymore. This guide however describes logging very
     briefly. Loot at full configuration documentation for detailed
     explanation.</p>
    <p>In standard sever configuration you usually want to turn off all logging
     to console and all warning and more serious notices directed to log
     file. Let's say logs will be written
     to <code>/var/log/tigase-server.log</code> which shouldn't get bigger than
     10MB and 5 old logs will be preserved. Here are instructions how to set
     options.</p>
    <p>Open <code>tigase-config.xml</code> in you favourite text editor and
     search for string: <strong>"logging"</strong>. You should find section
     looking like this:</p>
    <pre>  &#60;node name="logging">
   &#60;map>
    &#60;entry value="FINE" type="String" key=".level"/>
    &#60;entry value="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler+java.util.logging.FileHandler" type="String" key="handlers"/>
    &#60;entry value="tigase.util.LogFormatter" type="String" key="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter"/>
    &#60;entry value="WARNING" type="String" key="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level"/>
    &#60;entry value="true" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.append"/>
    &#60;entry value="5" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.count"/>
    &#60;entry value="tigase.util.LogFormatter" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter"/>
    &#60;entry value="ALL" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.level"/>
    &#60;entry value="100000" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit"/>
    &#60;entry value="logs%2Ftigase.log" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern"/>
    &#60;entry value="true" type="String" key="tigase.useParentHandlers"/>
   &#60;/map>
  &#60;/node></pre>
    <p>Assuming we make this guide easy and strightforward let me show how this
    section should look like after modification. So you could just copy and
    paste it to your config file without going into details. After the
    configuration code I will briefly explain what each line means so you
    should be able to further adjust settings for your needs.</p>
    <pre>  &#60;node name="logging">
   &#60;map>
    &#60;entry value="WARNING" type="String" key=".level"/>
    &#60;entry value="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler+java.util.logging.FileHandler" type="String" key="handlers"/>
    &#60;entry value="tigase.util.LogFormatter" type="String" key="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter"/>
    &#60;entry value="tigase.util.LogFormatter" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter"/>
    &#60;entry value="OFF" type="String" key="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level"/>
    &#60;entry value="true" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.append"/>
    &#60;entry value="5" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.count"/>
    &#60;entry value="ALL" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.level"/>

    <p>Each line explained:</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="WARNING" type="String" key=".level"/></strong></pre>
    <p>Effectively we set <code>WARNING</code> level for all possible logs for
     all possible <code>components</code>. So more detailed logging information will
     be discarded. All possible log levels
     are: <code>OFF</code>, <code>SEVERE</code>, <code>WARNING</code>,
     <code>INFO</code>, <code>CONFIG</code>, <code>FINE</code>,
     <code>FINER</code>, <code>FINEST</code>, <code>ALL</code>.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler+java.util.logging.FileHandler" type="String" key="handlers"/></strong></pre>

    <p>We set 2 handlers for logging information: console and file handler. As
     we are going to turn off logging to console we could remove all
     configuration settings for console handler as well. It would simplify
     configuration file. I don't recommend it though. If there are any problems
     with your installation switching console logging on might be very helpful
     and if you remove these settings from config file it may be difficult to
     bring them back. Hm... maybe not with such excellent documentation.... ;-)</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="tigase.util.LogFormatter" type="String" key="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter"/>
&#60;entry value="tigase.util.LogFormatter" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter"/></strong></pre>

    <p>We set here log formatter for console and file handler. Standard Java
     handlers print each log message in 2 lines. Tigase formatter prints all
     logging info in 1 line which make it much easier to filter logs by log
     type, logging component or log level or whatever you wish. You can just use
     simple <code>sed</code> command and that's it.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="OFF" type="String" key="java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level"/></strong></pre>

    <p>Here we just switch console handler off. To switch it on back set
     any different level from the list above.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="true" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.append"/></strong></pre>

    <p>This settings is to controll whether we want to append logs into old log
     file or we want to create new log file (removing old content) each time
     server is restarted.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="5" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.count"/></strong></pre>

    <p>Sets number of old log files to preserve to <code>5</code>.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="ALL" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.level"/></strong></pre>

    <p>This line sets the logging level for file handler. Here we set that we
     want all possible logs to be written to the file. The global level setting
     however says that only <code>WARNING</code> logs will be generated. So if
     you want to have more detailed logs you need to adjust global logging level.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="10000000" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit"/></strong></pre>

    <p>Log file maximum size set to 10MB. After reaching this size the log file
     is closed and new file is created.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="%2Fvar%2Flog%2Ftigase-server.log" type="String" key="java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern"/></strong></pre>

    <p>Location of the log file and file name:
     <code>/var/log/tigase-server.log</code>. Please note <strong>%2F</strong>
     instead of <strong>'/'</strong> character.</p>

    <pre><strong>&#60;entry value="true" type="String" key="tigase.useParentHandlers"/></strong></pre>

    <p>This setting requires going into more details so it is explained in
     comprehensive configuration guide.</p>
