		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>Copyright &copy; 2004 Tigase.org. &lt;http://www.tigase.org/&gt;</p>

		<p><strong>Tigase Jabber/XMPP Server</strong> is <strong>Open Source and Free
		(GPLv3)</strong> <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> based server. The
		goals behind the design and implementation of the server are: </p>

		<ol>
			<li>Make the server robust and reliable.</li>
			<li>Make the server secure communication platform.</li>
			<li>Make flexible server which can be applied to different use cases.</li>
			<li>Make extensible server which takes full advantage of XMPP protocol
			extensibility.</li>
			<li>Make the server easy to setup and maintain.</li>
		</ol>

		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Robust and reliable.</strong></dt>
			<dd><p>By robust and reliable server I mean the server which can handle many
			concurrent requests/connections and can run for a log time. By many
			concurrent requests/connections I mean as many as it is needed. The server
			is designed and implemented to handle milions of simultanous
			connections.</p>
			<p>It is not enough however to design and implement high
			load server and hope it will run well. The main focus in the project is put
			in tests. Tests are taken so seriously that dedicated <a
			href="http://testsuite.tigase.org/">testing framework</a> has been
			implemented. All server functions are considered as implemented only when
			they pass testing cycle. The testing cycle consists of 3 fundamental
			tests:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Functional tests - </strong> checking whether the function
				works at all.</li>
				<li><strong>Performance tests - </strong> checking whether the function
				performs well enough.</li>
				<li><strong>Stability tests - </strong> checking whether the function
				behaves well in long term run. It must handle hundreds of requests a
				second in several hours server run.</li>
			</ol>
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Secure</strong></dt>
			<dd><p>There are a few elements of the security related to Jabber/XMPP
			server: secure data transmissions which is met by the implementation of
			<strong>SSL</strong> or <strong>TLS</strong> protocol, secure user
			authorization which is met by the implementation of <strong>DIGEST</strong>
			or <strong>SASL</strong> user authorization and secure deplyoment which is
			met by component architecture.</p> <p><strong>Secure deployment</strong> is
			a software installation which doesn't impact network security. Companies
			usually have their networks divided into 2 parts: <strong>DMZ</strong>
			which is partially open to outside world and <strong>Private
			network</strong> which is closed to outside world.</p> <p>If the
			Jabber/XMPP server have to provide effective way of communication between
			company eployees regardles they are in company office or outside (perhaps
			at customer site) it needs to accept connections from outside world. So the
			natural place for server deployment is a <strong>DMZ</strong> part. There
			is an issue however with such installation. Each company has normally
			established network users base and integrated authorization mechanizms. So
			it would be very good if Jabber server could use this mechanizms for users
			authorizations as well. Usually, however, authorization information is not
			available in <strong>DMZ</strong> and it shouldn't be.</p>
			<p><strong>Tigase server</strong> offers solution for such case. With it's
			component structure it can be easily deployed on any number machines and
			from the user point of view it is seen as a one logical Jabber server. So
			in our case we can install <em>Session Manager</em> module in
			<strong>private</strong> network part and <em>Client Connection
			Manager</em> with <em>Server Connection Manager</em> in
			<strong>DMZ</strong>.<br/> <em>Session Manager</em> connects to
			<strong>DMZ</strong> and receives all packets from users. Thus is can
			sacurely realize users authorization based on company authorization
			mechanizms. </p></dd>
			<dt><strong>Flexibile</strong></dt>
			<dd>There are many different Jabber/XMPP server use cases. The most obvious
			are:
			<ul>
				<li>Used as bussiness communication platform in small and medium companies
				server is not under heavy load. Instead for such deployments security is a
				key feature.</li>
				<li>Fo huge community websites or internet portals server is on the other
				side usually under very heavy load and have to support tousands or
				millions of simultanous connections and for such deployment we talk about
				different kind of security as the service is open to public anyway.</li>
				<li>For very small community deployments or for small home networks the key
				factor is ease to deploy and maintain.</li>
				</ul> <p>Architecture based on components allows you to run selected modules
				on separate machines so the server can be easily applied to all
				scenarious.<br/> For simple installation server generates config file which
				can be used almost stright away with very few modifications or sometimes
				even no config editing is required. For complex deployments though you can
				tweak configuration to your needs and setup Jabber server on as many
				physical machines as you need.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><strong>Extensibile</strong></dt>
			<dd><p>The world changes all the time so people needs change as well.
			Jabber/XMPP protocol has been designed to be extensible to make it easy
			adding new features and apply it to different needs. As a result Jabber is
			a very effective platform not only for sending messages to mates. It can
			also be extended for sending instant notifications about events, it can be
			useful platform for on-line customer service, voice communication and all
			other cases where sending information instantly to other people is
			needed.</p> <p><strong>Tigase server</strong> has been designed to be
			extensible as well. Of course modular architecture makes it extensible as
			you can easily replace component which doesn't fullfill your requirements
			with another one better fiiting your needs. But this is not all. Another
			factor of extensibility is how easy is to replace component or add new
			extensions. The great focus has been put in server design API to make it
			easy for other software developers to create extensions and implement new
			features.</p></dd>
			<dt><strong>Easy</strong></dt>
			<dd><p>Complex computer networks consisting of many servers with different
			services are hard to maintain. There is no other way than employing
			professional staff and looking after the network.</p> <p>Not all networks
			are so complex however. Most small companies have just a few servers for
			their needs with services like e-mail, <code>HTTP</code> server with
			company website and that's it. They might want to add Jabber server to the
			collection of their services and don't want to dedicate much resources on
			setting it up and later maintanance. For such users default configuration
			is pretty much what they need. If operating system on the server is well
			configured then Tigase should pickup correct hostname.</p> <p>Tigase server
			is designed and implemnted to allow dynamic reconfiguration at runtime so
			there is no need for restarting server each time you want to change a
			configuration settings.</p> <p>There are also interfaces and handlers
			available to make it easy to implement web user interface for server
			monitoring and configuring. Such user interface will included in one of
			future releases.</p></dd>
